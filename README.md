This app is a work in progress.  What I think it does especially well is
to sort of provide an "intuition" for various periods of art history.  The
main selector shown here...

![](/readme-assets/period1.png?raw=true)
![](/readme-assets/period2.png?raw=true)

...allows the user to easily toggle between different periods in art history
and get a whole swath of representative examples.   For a lay-person, who isn't
an art historian, this is pretty useful just for placing a piece either in a period
that it came from, or placing the influences of a contemporary piece.
